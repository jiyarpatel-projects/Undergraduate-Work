# Undergraduate-Work
A collection of Public Health projects completed through Georgia State University. 
# 1. [Biological Hazards in Healthcare](https://github.com/jiyarpatel-projects/Undergraduate-Work/blob/e4a10aac570fa7b5d8aba9bcc93d607ba450b9c3/Biological%20Hazards%20in%20Healthcare%20What%20Every%20Clinical%20Student%20Must%20Know.pdf)
Course: Biological Hazards

Skills: Canva, Data Visualization, & Research

This project directly supports learning objectives in the Biological Hazards course by providing practical, healthcare‑specific insights into how biological agents affect health workers and patients, the science behind transmission and infection, and safe practices for hazard mitigation. Students gain foundational knowledge that complements lecture topics, clinical simulations, and safety protocols studied in the course.

#2. [Mental Health Among US Adolescents – Healthy People 2030](https://github.com/jiyarpatel-projects/Undergraduate-Work/blob/main/Mental_Health_Adolescents_HP2030.pdf)

Course: Fundementals of Epidemiology

Skills: Epidemiological Analysis, Sensitivity & Specificity Calculations, Public Health Policy, Data Visualization, & Screening Tool Evaluation

This project examines mental health burden among US adolescents through the lens of Healthy People 2030 objectives. Analysis includes prevalence and mortality rates, risk factors such as adverse childhood experiences, prevention strategies across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, and evaluation of screening tools including CAFAS. The study addresses barriers to screening, economic burden of youth mental health services, and public health interventions like CHIP, providing practical application of epidemiological methods and health policy analysis.

#3. [Association Between Moderate Work Activity and Being Overweight Among US Adults](https://github.com/jiyarpatel-projects/Undergraduate-Work/blob/main/Moderate_Work_Activity_Overweight_Study.pdf)

Course: Statistical Reasoning in Public Health

Skills: SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics 29), Logistic Regression Analysis, Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization, Cross-Sectional Study Design, & NHANES Data Analysis

This project examines the relationship between moderate work activity and physician-assessed overweight status among US adults aged 20 and above using NHANES 2017-2018 data (n=5,569). Statistical analysis includes descriptive statistics (mean age: 51.5 ± 17.8 years; prevalence rates: 38.8% overweight, 41.6% moderate work activity), data visualization through clustered bar charts and stratified box plots, and multivariable logistic regression modeling at α = 0.05 significance level. Key findings demonstrate participants with moderate work activity had significantly higher odds of being told they were overweight by a doctor (AOR: 1.42, p<0.001) after adjusting for gender, education, age, and income-to-poverty ratio. The project applies epidemiological study design principles, controls for confounding variables including socioeconomic factors (income-to-poverty ratio: mean 2.6 ± 1.6), and interprets odds ratios while acknowledging limitations of cross-sectional data and self-reported measures—demonstrating practical application of biostatistical methods in public health research.
