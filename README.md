# 1. [Biological Hazards in Healthcare](https://github.com/jiyarpatel-projects/Undergraduate-Work/blob/e4a10aac570fa7b5d8aba9bcc93d607ba450b9c3/Biological%20Hazards%20in%20Healthcare%20What%20Every%20Clinical%20Student%20Must%20Know.pdf)
Course: Biological Hazards
Skills: Canva, Data Visualization, & Research
This project directly supports learning objectives in the Biological Hazards course by providing practical, healthcare‑specific insights into how biological agents affect health workers and patients, the science behind transmission and infection, and safe practices for hazard mitigation. Students gain foundational knowledge that complements lecture topics, clinical simulations, and safety protocols studied in the course.
